                <h4>This website is made to help myself and others like you reading this to make <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">Mods</span>, <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">Quests</span>, <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">Items</span>, and more for <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">SPTarkov</span>.</h4>
            
                <h4>But I have been banned for <span style="color: #ff6347; padding: 2px;">dumb reasons</span>, so this website will be private until I am unbanned.</h4>
            
                <h4>I was inspired by the mod "<span style="color: #87ceeb; padding: 2px;">Kaeno-TraderScrolling</span>" and since it was not updated to <span style="color: #87ceeb; padding: 2px;">3.10</span> I decided to make my own. It works the same way as the original mod but with <span style="color: #00ff00; padding: 2px;">different code</span> and a few <span style="color: #00ff00; padding: 2px;">extra features</span>. I was requested to keep the same License which should not matter because it's a completely different code and i always upload everything i make as <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">MIT</span> license. Even so, the source code license of "<span style="color: #87ceeb; padding: 2px;">Kaeno-TraderScrolling</span>" is <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">MIT</span>, but it is uploaded to the Hub as <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">NCSA</span>. I have no idea why they have two different licenses, but I changed it to <span style="color: #ffa500; padding: 2px;">NCSA</span> to please the SPT Moderator that made my mod hidden. It was then approved and not hidden anymore.</h4>
            
                <h4>I was then messaged by Drakia, to whom I asked to straight-up copy code snippets from <span style="color: #87ceeb; padding: 2px;">Gilded Key Storage</span> that allows you to put into the secure container. I never stated I would change the code i would copy. A few weeks later, he messaged me and mentioned it had some extra features that I overstepped which i did not realise i did. I was given the chance to remove them, which I was going to do. However, before I was able to make these changes, I was banned for <span style="color: #ff6347; padding: 2px;">"stealing code"</span>, which I never did. I was going to change it but was banned before I could do so. I tried to ask the person who banned me to unban me, but they never responded. The ban message i received was <span style="color: #ff6347; padding: 2px;">"Multiple Repeated Rule 6 Violations"</span> which is <span style="color: #ff6347; padding: 2px;">"Don't steal other people's work."</span> I was not even given a warning of what they think i stole.</h4>
            
                <h4>That is my story, and I hope you understand why this website is private. I will make everything public again once I am unbanned.</h4>
                <h4>I was really looking forward to making more tools and mods for the community, but I guess I will have to wait for the moderators to rectify their mistake.</h4>
